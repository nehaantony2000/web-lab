<h1>Use navigation in the Google Maps app</h1>
To get easy, turn-by-turn navigation to places, use the Google Maps app.
 Maps will show you directions and use real-time traffic information to find the best route to your destination. 

With voice navigation, youâ€™ll hear traffic alerts, where to turn, which lane to use, and if there's a better route.

Important: Navigation and info about which lane to use aren't available in all regions and languages. 
Navigation isn't intended to be used by oversized or emergency vehicles.
