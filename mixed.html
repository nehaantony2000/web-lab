<h1>
 Types of Navigation
</h1>
 You must determine the purpose and importance of the navigation within your site, 
bringing similar options together and presenting them as a cohesive unit.
 Of course, there are conventions to get you started—bars and tabs are commonly used for the main navigation, 
vertical mechanisms on the left for local navigation—but there are no set usage rules, 
and many variations exist.
